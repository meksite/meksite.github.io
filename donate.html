      <h3>When considering a donation, keep the following points in mind:</h3>
      <p>1. Purpose: Understand the specific causes or projects your donation will support. Masjids often have various initiatives, such as education programs, community services, maintenance projects, or relief efforts.</p>
      <p>2. Trustworthiness: Ensure that the masjid is a reputable and transparent organization. You can research its history, financial accountability, and credibility before making your donation.</p>
      <p>3. Channels: Identify the preferred donation channels of the masjid. They may accept donations in person, through their website, or via specific payment platforms. Check if they provide receipts or acknowledgment for your contribution.</p>
      <p>4. Regular Giving: Consider making regular donations, such as monthly or yearly contributions. Regular giving ensures ongoing support for the masjid's operations and allows for better planning and budgeting.</p>
      <p>5. Zakat: If you intend to fulfill your obligatory Zakat, confirm if the masjid accepts Zakat donations and if they allocate those funds to eligible recipients in accordance with Islamic principles</p>
      <p>6. Non-Monetary Contributions: Besides monetary donations, masjids often welcome volunteer work or donations in the form of goods, services, or expertise. Inquire about any specific needs they may have.</p>
      <p>Remember, the intention behind your donation is essential. Donate with a sincere heart, seeking the pleasure of Allah and aiming to benefit the community. Your contribution, no matter the size, can make a positive impact and help the masjid in fulfilling its mission of serving the Muslim community and promoting Islamic values.</p>
