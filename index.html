      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Our Masjid serves as a place of worship where Muslims come together to perform daily prayers, Friday congregational prayers (Jummah), and special prayers during Islamic holidays. Our spacious prayer hall provides a peaceful and serene atmosphere, allowing worshippers to connect with Allah and find solace in their faith.</p>
      <p>In addition to regular prayers, our Masjid offers a range of educational programs and activities for individuals of all ages. We are committed to providing opportunities for learning and spiritual growth through Quranic study circles, Islamic lectures, and classes on various aspects of Islam. We believe that knowledge is the key to understanding and practicing Islam in a meaningful way.</p>
      <p>We welcome everyone, regardless of their background, to join us in prayer and participate in our activities. Our doors are open to Muslims and non-Muslims alike who are interested in learning about Islam, fostering interfaith dialogue, or simply seeking a peaceful environment for reflection.</p>
